<p>Peer parts can be seen as an attempt to make a construction set for DIY design. It is meant to be used by non-experts to construct and form their own living environment. </p>
<p>Unlike a construction set however, Peer-Parts is not a self-enclosed system of &#39;official&#39; parts, nor does it enforce any standardization. Instead it attempts to latch on, subvert, incorporate or parasitize any existing components or structures in order to combine them in an ad-hoc way.</p>
<p><em>Peer Parts</em> relies primarily on an open source CAD system that allows anyone to contribute, share and manufacture parts and assemblies.

<p>Rather than using a regular grid-like pattern to design parts, the system defines parts as <strong>parametric</strong> geometry. This means dimensions can be changed to fit the situation. To facilitate fit between parts, a parametric search engine finds emergent fit. Instead of having to search for a certain piece by hand, the software computationally finds fitting parts in the network.</p>
<p><img src="images/assemblyNetwork.png" alt="interfaces" title="interfaces"></p>
<p>The parametric model increases the chance of inter-operability, because parts are loosly-fitted and scale-indepent.
This allows the system to be applicable within many domains, including household design, hardware hacking or even architecture.</p>

<p>Components contain information about the possible materials and manufacturing methods that are available for it.
Production facilities and shops (fab-labs, people with 3d printers, parts-stores, etc) can set up a sourcing node. Each node can bid in a virtual marketplace to deliver the part at a certain price, dependent on your location. Price information can be used to generate price estimations for a project. Alternatively there could simply be a centralized <em>Peer Parts</em> webshop.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p><em>Peer Parts</em> could be implemented in a number of ways, including a peer-to-peer network in a stand alone application. Another option could be a website and editing app.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hocism">Ad-hocism</h2>
<p>Central to the <em>Peer Parts</em> system is the idea that &#39;design&#39; objects may look great in pictures, reality is often a tingle-tangle mess of lo and hi-fi solutions (i.e. broken smartphones fixed with duct-tape). Rather than trying to design perfect objects, everyday improvised solutions to problems should be embraced. Empowering people over &#39;designers&#39; to create their own environment by iterative and playful search (trying, retrying, adapting, breaking down).
Instead of creating singular throw-away units, <em>Peer Parts</em> focuses on modular design. Broken parts can be replaced, obsolescent units can be taken apart and reused or sold.</p>
