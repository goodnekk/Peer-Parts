# Peer Parts
An **open source, socio-technical** system for **do-it-yourself** design using **digital manufacturing**.


## Philosopy
The *Peer Parts* project explores the possibility of a [emergent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), distributed [construction set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_set). Where traditional construction sets rely heavily on standardization and meticulous top-down design, *Peer Parts* proposes a radically different approach. It relies primarily on an open source CAD system that allows anyone to contribute, share and manufacture parts and assemblies. The network facilitates a certain resonance between disparate design efforts that enables ultimate inter-operability. There are several ways that this wil work:

### Parametrics and interfaces

![interfaces](images/assembly.png "interfaces")

The system defines parts as parametric geometry. Rather than using a regular grid-like system to facilitate fit between parts, a parametric search engine finds emergent fit. That is, rather than having to search for a certain piece by hand, The software computationally finds fitting parts in the network.
The parametric model increases the chance of inter-operability, because parts are loosly-fitted and scale-indepent.


### Peer-to-peer manufacture

### Ad-hocism
