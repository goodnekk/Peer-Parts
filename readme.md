# Peer Parts
An **open source, socio-technical** system for **do-it-yourself** design using **digital manufacturing**.


## Philosopy
The *Peer Parts* project explores the possibility of a distributed, [emergent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) [construction set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_set). Where traditional construction sets rely heavily on standardization and meticulous top-down design, *Peer Parts* proposes a radically different approach. It relies primarily on an open source CAD system that allows anyone to contribute, share and manufacture parts and assemblies. The network facilitates a certain resonance between disparate design efforts that enables ultimate inter-operability. There are several ways that this wil work:

    ### Parametrics and interfaces

    ### Peer-to-peer manufacture

    ### Ad-hocism


## Implementation
