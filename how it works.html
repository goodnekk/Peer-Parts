<h3 id="parametrics-and-interfaces">Parametrics and interfaces</h3>
<p>Where traditional construction sets rely heavily on standardization and meticulous top-down design, <em>Peer Parts</em> proposes a radically different approach. It relies primarily on an open source CAD system that allows anyone to contribute, share and manufacture parts and assemblies.
<img src="images/parametric.png" alt="parametric" title="parametric"></p>
<p>The system defines parts as parametric geometry. Rather than using a regular grid-like system to facilitate fit between parts, a parametric search engine finds emergent fit. Instead of having to search for a certain piece by hand, the software computationally finds fitting parts in the network.</p>
<p><img src="images/assemblyNetwork.png" alt="interfaces" title="interfaces"></p>
<p>The parametric model increases the chance of inter-operability, because parts are loosly-fitted and scale-indepent.
This allows the system to be applicable within many domains, including household design, hardware hacking or even architecture.</p>

<p>Components contain information about the possible materials and manufacturing methods that are available for it.
Production facilities and shops (fab-labs, people with 3d printers, parts-stores, etc) can set up a sourcing node. <del>Bidding in a virtual marketplace to deliver the part at a certain price, dependent on your location.</del> Price information can be used to generate price estimations for a project. Alternatively there could simply be a centralized <em>Peer Parts</em> webshop.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p><em>Peer Parts</em> could be implemented in a number of ways, including a website and editing app. Another option could be an actual peer-to-peer network in a stand alone application.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hocism">Ad-hocism</h2>
<p>Central to the <em>Peer Parts</em> system is the idea that &#39;design&#39; objects may look great in pictures, reality is often a tingle-tangle mess of lo and hi-fi solutions (i.e. broken smartphones fixed with duct-tape). Rather than trying to design perfect objects, everyday improvised solutions to problems should be embraced. Empowering people over &#39;designers&#39; to create their own environment by iterative and playful search (trying, retrying, adapting, breaking down).
Instead of creating singular throw-away units, <em>Peer Parts</em> focuses on modular design. Broken parts can be replaced, obsolescent units can be taken apart and reused or sold.</p>
